To reproduce the report, simply download imagem1.txt, imagem2.txt, imagem3.txt, which would contain the data files, 
change up the working directories, and run 521Proj2_Question_1_4 to reproduce figures for question 1&4, 521Proj2_Question_2_3 to reproduce figures for question 2&3.

A direct knit might not work, and if not please simply run the code chunks one by one and the correct figures should be very simply reproducible. 

As an additional note to the CVmaster.R function file, you do not need to CVmaster R file to run 521Proj2_Question_1_4, or 521Proj2_Question_2_3, as the CV Masters function
is copied into each of those as well. The CVmaster.R file simply serves as a reference.
